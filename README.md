# Beers-Api

This project was written in react, and uses the punk api to fetch and render lists of beers.
It was an opportunity to put into practice what i had learned about APIs, as well as improving my react, especially the use of hooks.
I was particularly proud of the way that I generated and checked the search criteria, using an array of objects conatining the search parameter, and mapping over the arrap to a component.
