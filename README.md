# beers.api

This project was a way to learn about apis, and how to send calls and process responses into a useable format. 
The app was also the first thing I wrote in react. I was particularly pleased with the way that I created and processed the filters and search terms, using an array to generate checkboxes. 
I also hosted the app on github pages to understand that process.
